# Create-RapidStart

This example C# code uses LINQ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/working-with-linq to convert a CSV file into XML and compresses that XML in the format the BC uses for RapidStart packages.

In input CSV that the code reads is included : FA.csv

The output files are FA.xml and FA.rapidstart - to open the rapidstart file just use 7zip or WinRAR
